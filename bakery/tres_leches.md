# Tres leches cake

**Ingredients**
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 5 eggs (large)
- 1 cup sugar divided into 3/4 and 1/4 cups
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup whole milk

**Syrup**
- 12 oz evaporated milk
- 9 oz sweetened condensed milk
- 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream

**Frosting**
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- 2 Tbsp granulated sugar
- 1 cup berries to garnish, optional

**Process**

1. Preheat the oven to 350 °F and butter a 9x13 casserole pan. Set up three mixing bowls.
2. In a large bowl, sift together 1 cup flour, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, and 1/4 salt.
3. Separate egg whites and yolks into the other two bowls.
4. Beat egg yolks with 3/4 cup sugar with an electric mixer on high speed, until yolks are a pale yellow (2 minutes). Stir in 1/3 cup milk and 1 tsp vanilla.
5. Beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form (1 minute). With the mixer on, pour in remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat on high speed until egg whites are stiff but not dry (1 minute)
6. Pour egg yolk mixture over the flour mixture and combine gently with a spatula.
7. Gently fold in egg white mixture with the spatula until just combined. Pour batter into prepared pan and spread to even out the surface and bake at 350˚F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.

**3-Milk Syrup**

In a large measuring cup (or a bowl with a pouring lip), combine 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream, 12 oz evaporated milk and 9 oz condensed milk. When the cake is cool, pierce the surface all over with a fork. Slowly drizzle the milk mixture over the cake.

**Whipped Cream Frosting**

Pour 2 cups cold heavy whipping cream and 2 Tbsp sugar into a large chilled mixing bowl and beat on high speed 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or until thick, whipped and spreadable. Spread over the cake with a spatula then decorate with berries if desired.

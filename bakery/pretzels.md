# Homemade soft pretzels

**Ingredients**
- 4 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (600 grams)
- 2 and 1/4 tsp instant yeast (7 grams)
- 1 Tbs sugar (12 grams)
- 1 tsp salt (10 grams)
- 1 cup warm water (235 grams)
- 3/4 cup milk (185 grams)

**Topping**
- coarse salt for sprinkling
- 1 egg (for egg wash)
- butter for brushing (optional)

**Process**

1. Place the ingredients in the mixer and knead on low speed until the dough comes together and 
   is soft to the touch, about 8 minutes.
2. Let it rise in a greased bowl, covered, until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
3. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
4. Divide the dough into 8–12 equal pieces using a bench scraper or knife.
5. Roll each piece into a rope about 20 inches (50 cm) long.
6. Form each rope into a pretzel shape.
7. Place the pretzels on the prepared baking sheets, cover with a clean kitchen towel, 
   and let them rest for 15 minutes.
8. Prepare a soda bath: in a pot, bring 4 cups of water and 2 tablespoons of baking soda to a boil.
9. Carefully lower each pretzel into the boiling soda bath for about 30 seconds. 
   Use a slotted spatula to remove it and return it to the baking sheets.
10. Brush each pretzel with an egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon of water) and 
    sprinkle with coarse salt.
11. Bake in the preheated oven for 12–15 minutes, or until golden brown.
12. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack before serving.
13. Brush them with butter while still warm, if desired.

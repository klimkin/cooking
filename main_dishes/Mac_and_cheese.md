# Mac and Cheese

**Ингредиенты**
* 1/2 lb uncooked elbow macaroni
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1.5 Tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1½ cups milk
* 1/2 cup cream
* 225g shredded cheddar cheese

**Процесс**
* Preheat the oven to 325F and lightly grease an 8' square (or similar size) baking dish.
* Cook the macaroni to al dente, according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.
* Make the sauce: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Blend in the flour, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes. Slowly add the milk and half and half, stirring constantly, and cook over medium-low heat for a few minutes until the mixture has thickened like the consistency of gravy, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 cup shredded cheese, stirring just until melted.
* Combine: Add the cooked macaroni noodles and toss to coat. Pour half or the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle ½ cup cheese over the top. Add remaining pasta and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
* Bake for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted on top.
